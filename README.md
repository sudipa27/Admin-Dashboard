<b>Sales Analysis of an E-commerce store using Power Bi</b><hr>
<b>Project Overview:</b><br>
In this Power BI project, I aimed to analyze sales data to gain valuable insights into the company's revenue performance and understand the average order value. The primary objectives were to identify sales trends, top-selling products, and analyze customer behavior to optimize marketing strategies.
<br>
<b>Data Sources:</b><br>
The project utilized data from various sources, including transactional data, customer data, and product information. 
<br>
<b>Data Preparation and Cleaning:</b><br>
Before creating visualizations, we performed data preparation and cleaning using Power Query in Power BI. This involved filtering out irrelevant data, handling missing values, and formatting the data appropriately for analysis.
<br>
<b>Visualizations:</b>
<br>We designed a range of data visualizations using Power BI, including:
<ul>
  <li><b>Profit by Month </b> : Stack column chart was used to display the profit over each month</li>
  <li><b>Sum of Profit by Category</b> : Stack Bar chart was employed to display the most profitable items </li>
  <li><b>Top-Selling Products:</b> A  pie chart was employed to display the best-selling products based on the number of units sold.</li>
  <li><b>Average Order Value (AOV):</b> A KPI card  was used to highlight the average order value, providing insights into customers' spending habits.</li>
  <li><b>Sales by Region:</b> We created a stack column visualization to show sales performance geographically, identifying regions with the highest sale</li>
  <li><b>Top Customers </b> : We also created a stack column bar to display the top customers</li>
</ul>
<br>
Also added filters and slicers to enable the user to see specific state sales and the sales made in a certain quarter of year.
